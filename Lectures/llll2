Chapter 2- Errors

# Problem Solving with computer

**Problem solving with computers involves several steps:**

 1. Clearly define the problem.
 2. Analyse the problem and formulate a method to solve it (see also “validation”).
 3. Describe the solution in the form of an algorithm.
 4. Draw a flowchart of the algorithm.
 5. Write the computer program.
 6. Compile and run the program (debugging).
 7. Test the program (debugging) (see also “verification”).
 8. Interpretation of results

What is Numerical Error?
