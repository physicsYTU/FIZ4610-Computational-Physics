COMPUTERS have become an indispensable part of the physicist's life. Physicists, like many people, use computers to read and write and communicate. 
But computers are also central to the work of calculating and understanding that allows one to make scientific progress in physics. Physicists use 
computers for solving equations, doing integrals, calculating functions, inverting matrices, and simulating physical processes of all kinds. 
Performing computer calculations requires skill and knowledge to get reliable, accurate answers and avoid the many pitfalls.

This course will give participants an introduction to the solution of physics problems using computers.

The course will introduce the basic ideas and programming skills of computational physics and students will develop their own computer 
software to solve problems in physics.

This course based on the fundamentals of computational physics and describes in simple terms a wide range of techniques that every physicist 
should know, such as numerical derivative, integral, fitting and etc.

Making Computers Obey

The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and 
so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist 
who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, 
to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the 
results will be correct. 
*- Donald E. Knuth


** A good program should**

Give the correct answers.

Be clear and easy to read, with the action of each part easy to analyze.

Document itself for the sake of readers and the programmer.

Be easy to use.

Be built up out of small programs that can be independently verified.

Be easy to modify and robust enough to keep giving correct answers after modification 
and simple debugging.

🌱 Document the data formats used.🌱 

Use trusted libraries.

Be published or passed on to others to use and to develop further.

One attraction of object-oriented programming is that it enforces these rules automatically. 
An elementary way to make any program clearer is to structure it with indentation, skipped 
lines, and parentheses placed strategically.This is performed to provide visual clues to the 
function of the different program parts (the “structures” in structured programming). In fact, 
Python uses indentations as structure elements as well as for clarity. Although the space 
limitations of a printed page keep us from inserting as many blank lines as we would prefer,
we recommend that you do as we say and not as we do!

Description

The use of computers in physics has grown enormously over the last half century, to the point 
where they play a central role in virtually every new physics discovery. From particle physics 
and astrophysics to quantum computing and biophysics, calculations on computers have become an 
indispensable tool of scientists today.

Last issue of Physical Review Letters 

26 out of 47 publications exclusively or essentially rely on large scale computations! 

In every single section: 

• General Physics: Statistical, Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Information, etc. 
• Gravitation and Astrophysics
• Elementary Particles and Fields
• Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics 
• Nonlinear Dynamics, Fluid Dynamics, Classical Optics, etc. 
• Plasma and Beam Physics
• Condensed Matter: Structure, etc.
• Condensed Matter: Electronic Properties, etc. 
• Soft Matter, Biological, and Interdisciplinary Physics 

This course gives an introduction to the solution of physics problems using computers. 
Assuming no previous computer programming experience, the course will introduce the basic 
ideas and programming skills of computational physics and students will develop their own
computer software to solve problems in quantum mechanics, atomic physics, astrophysics, 
condensed matter, nonlinear dynamics and chaos, biophysics, and other areas.
How are computers used? 

Upon completion of this course students will:

1.Understand computational thinking and how it applies to programming and problem solving at this level.
2.Understand the role and importance of computing and programming in engineering disciplines.
3.Understand and apply fundamental programming skills in Python and MATLAB.
4.Apply these to solve problems in engineering.

Rather incomplete list 

•	Fluid dynamics, plasma simulations: particle-in-cell (PIC) codes 
•	Precision calculations of atomic and molecular properties: Hartree Fock (HF), Configuration Interaction (CI) 
•	Solid state electronic structure: density functional theory (DFT), dynamical mean field theory (DMF) 
•	“Soft matter”: molecular dynamics (MD), multi-scale techniques

•	Transport in solids and nano-structures: Greens-function techniques 
•	Large statistical systems: Monte-Carlo techniques 
•	Qauntum Chromo Dynamics (QCD): e.g. lattice gauge theory 
•	etc. ... 

**Coursework**

Classroom time will be spent primarily on learning the principles and techniques behind 
computational physics methods. A typical exercise will describe a physics problem that can 
be solved using a method studied in class and ask you to write a program to solve it and 
present your results.

Collaboration is allowed when doing exercises and labs, but you must write your own programs 
and turn in your own work. Direct copying from others is not allowed. You may use example 
programs from the textbook as a starting point for your work, but copying from any other 
source, including books or the Internet, is not allowed.

The exams differ from the labs and homeworks in that collaboration is not allowed. All 
exam problems must be solved without consulting others or copying from any source, except
again that you may use programs from the textbook as a starting point. The dates of the 
midterms are listed on the schedule below. 

The course grade will be 60% on the midterm and  40% on the final exam.

**Textbook**

The textbook for the course is Computational Physics with Fortran and Python, B Karaoğlu. 
Notes on git is useful.
There are other good textbooks on computational physics using Python and other languages. 
As a general reference for numerical methods I can also recommend the following:

• Numerical Methods for Engineers Steven C. Chapra, Raymond P. Canale Sixth Edition, McGraw-Hill
• Bekir Karaoğlu - CP Book
•	Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing, William H. Press, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. 
Vetterling, and Brian P. Flannery, 3rd Edition (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2007).

Lectures, Labs, Attendance, Exams

Lectures:

Wednesdays { 13:30-16:00, two-hour lecture \
Thursdays { 08:30-10:20, two-hour lab \

**Grading:**

I hope every student will get grade AA

It will be based on two mid-term exams and final exam: Midterms 30% each, Final 40%.

** Python **

• Easy to use
• Object oriented
• Many packages available — graphics, linear algebra, . . . 
• Free and open source
• Platform independent Problems


**Requirements**

Calculus, linear algebra, and physics will be required to understand the material. 
No previous programming experience is required. The course will make use of the Python 
programming language, and will begin with an introduction to programming in Python.
The course will require you to do a fair amount of programming work on your own time. 
One of the advantages of the Python programming language is that it is available for 
free, which means that if you have a computer you can download a copy of Python and 
work on your own computer. Most people should install version 3 of Python, which is 
the most recent version, but you can also use version 2 if you wish. (Some Mac users, 
particular those with older Macs, have reported that version 2 works better with their 
computers.) If you use version 2, then for compatibility you need to include the following 
line at the start of each program you write:

from __future__ import division,print_function

Note that there are two underscore symbols before the word future and another two after it. 
You can also use version 2 with this book if you wish. Some computers come with version 
2 already installed, or you may have installed it yourself in the past and want to go on using it. 
If so, you can do that, but you need to take one extra precaution. There are a few small 
differences between versions 2 and 3 that affect some of the programs in the book, but you 
can get around this by the following simple trick. If you are using version 2 of Python, add 
the following line at the very beginning of every program you run: 

```python
 from __future__ import division,print_function
```

(Note the two underscore characters “__” on either side of the word “future”.) 
If you include this line in your programs, it makes version 2 of Python behave 
essentially the same as version 3. Add it to the start of any of the example programs 
in the book and they will work with version 2. Add it to the start of the programs 
you yourself write, and they will work as they would in version 3.
